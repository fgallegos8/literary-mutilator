    Tacos for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or
    citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla. You see, the refried beans are really just the
        adhesive necessary to apply the soft tortilla to the hard taco shell.</p>
